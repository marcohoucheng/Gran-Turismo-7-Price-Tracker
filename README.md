# Gran Turismo 7 tracker for in-game dynamic prices for cars

This is a personal project built on Python to obtain in-game stores information of Gran Turismo 7 without the necessarity to manually start the game on PlayStation 5. It has the following functionalities:

- An automated daily email to list updates in game.
- Aggregate data to build a local database of cars' historical prices,
- Return latest information of cars given a wish list.

Data are scraped from https://github.com/ddm999/gt7info. Tools providing similar information are available on https://gtdb.io. However, the site requires an account to receive daily emails. The setup of this project allows for a setup without having to sign up for an account.

The approach of this project is to provide a solution without setting an account.

# Usage

## Daily Email

A scheduled Github Action is currently set up. However, the user can easily set up a similar system. Only `email_update.py` is needed in this case with the appropriate environment varibles for `SENDER_EMAIL`, `PASSWORD` and `RECIPIENTS`. A [screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcohoucheng/Gran-Turismo-7-Price-Tracker/main/data/email_screenshot.png) of the email and the latest html copy is shown below.

## Wish list and local database

1. Build databases by running `build.py`. It will also detect whether `shop.py` and `car.py` should be run.
    - Only the respective shop will be built if ran with flag `used` or `legend`. Nevertheless, `shop.py` and `car.py` will still be triggered if necessary.
2. Run `update.py` to update the local shop databases.
    - Similar to `build.py`, `used` or `legend` flags can be called.
3. `wish.py` checks whether cars in the wish list `wish_list.txt` are available today. If so, then it will return the price. Otherwise, it returns the last available date and the price.
    - This script will automatically run `update.py` when checking whather cars on wish list are available.
4. Running `today.py` returns items available in the shops in terminal. With flag `new` the script will only return new days of the day.
